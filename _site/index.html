<p>The respect for tradition, with the right touch of modernity is Windsor’s hallmark and makes it a place of reference to understand the evolution of Catalan cuisine. Here traditional recipes cooked by chef Carlos Alconchel seem different. They’re fresher, bolder and lighter, but at the same time they still evoke the taste that we all have engraved in the depths of our memory. These are recipes with a new life, surprising and modern.</p>

<p>Passatge de la Concepció –a private and quiet passage that connects Passeig de Gràcia and Rambla Catalunya– seems to be the fetish of <strong>Grupo Tragaluz</strong>, since there are <strong>three of fifteen restaurants</strong> that prestigious group has in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Open since 1989, Tragaluz is its flagship restaurant. Located on the top floor of El Japonés, the restaurant has a complete renovation since 2011 that makes it even more attractive.</p>
<p>We have retained <strong>two levels</strong> and the movable glass roof that allows to enjoy lunches and dinners under the sun or in the moonlight. The first level has a wonderful open kitchen, while the second is also perfect to taste exquisite cocktails.</p>
<p>Moreover, the restaurant remains true to the formula that has achieved so much success. It is a modern Mediterranean-inspired cuisine made with fresh ingredients and always well presented.</p>

<p>One of the trendiest restaurants in the late 80’s and early 90’s is back in Barcelona after a two-decade absence. Originally placed where now lies the modern Hotel Omm, Mordisco was reopened in late 2010, again by the prestigious Rosa Esteva’s Grupo Tragaluz.</p>
<p>Now on <em>Passatge de la Concepció</em> –its neighbours are Tragaluz and El Japonés–, the restaurant is located in a old stately house that has been renovated with exquisite taste by Sandra Tarruella, Rosa Esteva’s daughter, who has managed to create a modern, cosy and elegant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Behind the original facade, <strong>Mordisco</strong> welcomes us with a charming little delicatessen shop where we can buy everything from wine, preserves, cheeses and sausages, to organic vegetables and dishes from the menu to take away. Before entering the restaurant’s dining room, we will come across a nice waiting area with low tables and a bar perfect for informal meals.</p>
<p>The main dining room, dominated by a work by Mariscal, is covered by a glass roof that incorporates the interior patio and that, at day time, is flooded with natural light. The large central staircase leads to the top floor, that boasts a warmer ambience and houses the cocktail bar, spaces with sofas, armchairs and low tables and a reading area with a fireplace.</p>

<p>Tapas, montaditos, paella, salads, fried eggs and ‘pepitos’ make up <strong>Casa Lola’s</strong> food offer. And to drink, we could not miss the traditional sangria, which is prepared here to the client’s taste with red wine, white wine or cava and combined with red fruits, mint and citrus, melon and watermelon… In addition, they have a good selection of wines and cocktails.</p>
<p>The restaurant is divided into two floors, connected by an emblematic spiral staircase, and also has a pleasant terrace on Rambla Catalunya (not bookable).</p>

<p>In classical mythology, Bacchus was the god of wine, ritual madness and religious ecstasy. That’s why at this restaurant, will raise you up a few metres above street level. To be precise, the first floor above La Rambla where it merges with Plaça Catalunya.</p>
<p>Down below… the world, the lights, the hustle-and-bustle and the everyday comings and goings of Barcelona. Up above… the pleasure of flavours, smells, colours, ingredients and serenity.</p>
<p>A simply divine location, menu and space.</p>

<p><strong>Bar Lobo</strong> is a bar that mixes tapas with light and main dishes for all tastes. Located in a small part of what onces was the old General Tobacco Company of Philippines building, and now is the luxurious Hotel 1898.</p>
<p>This is a modern room with a huge graffiti on the wall and several large windows that look out onto Pintor Fortuny Street. It’s aesthetically attractive and very functional, because between the bar stools, the terrace, the tables and the sofas, there are many places to sit down to eat.</p>
<p>The menu includes dishes such as sautéed rice with mushrooms and ginger, tapas like ‘bravas’ fries, fried artichokes or some with guacamole, as well as all kinds of salads and wok dishes. Some nights , a DJ plays good music while drinks are served, so it’s a good place to start a night out in the city center.</p>
